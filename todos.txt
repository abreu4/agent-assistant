-bundle all commands in "man" manual style
-save links to direct job posting not to general company website
-implement short term memory
-give it a starting prompt telling it it is an job application helping agent with access to xyz tools
-"models" and "switch" command should also list local models
-"sticky" makes no sense, should default to first working model if none selected, once user selects a remote or local model, persist it for that mode (local/remote)
-agent should be able to rank most relevant jobs, and save full raw description related to them to re-rank when more jobs come in
